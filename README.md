# Client-Server-Face-Recognition
Same as the Face-Recognition Project I did before, but this time, I used python sockets to transfer (small, low-res) images from a client computer to a server computer, which then returns a name associated with the face image

This project is meant to be extended upon and can serve as a basis for other face recognition-related projects
